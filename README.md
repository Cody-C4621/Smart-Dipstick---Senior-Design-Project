This is the home of the Smart Dipstick project!

This project works on the Adafruit Feather M0 BLE microcontroller.

This project takes samples of oil temperature and a voltage of oil in order to determine if oil is good, in need of changing soon, or if it is bad and in need of dire change. It sends Bluetooth Low Energy signals to work with our Android application.

With the Version 1.1 Update, our project now runs with a FreeRTOS library to collect samples and send BLE signals simultaneously for better readings and signal outputs to the app.
